Netflix What Is John Cena's Farewell Tour Salary According to WWE RAW?

Despite working part-time at the moment, WWE star John Cena receives an annual income of almost $8.5 million. He earns $500,000 for each appearance at a major event in addition to his normal pay, and he keeps 5% of the sales of his stuff.

After a ten-year, $5 billion deal between WWE and Netflix, WWE's "Raw" started airing live on Netflix every Monday night beginning of January 2025.

Although Cena's exact compensation for his appearances on "Raw" under this new streaming agreement has not been made public, it is safe to assume that his earnings per appearance would be in line with his regular rates, possibly with the addition of bonuses related to the new streaming agreement.

Top-tier performers like Cena might get a bump in pay given the huge sum from the Netflix contract. However, the precise numbers remain conjectural in the absence of formal declarations.
